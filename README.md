Python assignmengts- PyBank & PyPoll.

Two complete python challenges PyBank & PyPoll

PyBank:Analyze the financial rocord of the company.

Analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll:Helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

Analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Before you begin: 
Create PyBank folder, add the following content:
A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

Folders and work:

Created PyBank folder,inside PyBank created Resources folder, Financial analysis folder and main.ipynb jupiter notebook
Inside Resources, I have budget_data_csv file and inside Financial analysis folder-> analysis.txt file & analysis1.txt file
I work on main.ipynb jupiter workbook

And exported the results/answer on analysis1.txt file for PyBank

Created PyPoll folder,inside PyPoll created Resources folder, Election Results folder and main.ipynb jupiter notebook
Inside Resources, I have election_data_csv file and inside Election Results folder-> election1.txt file & election.txt file
I work on main.ipynb jupiter workbook

And exported the results/answer on election1.txt file for PyPoll


Hints and Considerations

Consider what you've learned so far. You've learned how to import modules like csv. You’ve learned how to read and write files in various formats. 
You’ve learned how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries. 
You’ve learned how to iterate through basic data structures. And you’ve learned how to debug along the way. Using all that you've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.
The datasets for these Challenges are quite large. This was done purposefully to showcase one of the limits of Excel-based analysis.
As data analysts, our first instinct is often to go straight to Excel, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more powerful options for handling big data.
Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.
Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! 

Taken into consideration all the above hints. 
I completed PyBank & PyPoll python projects by consulting python documentation, went through all class materials and took some help from xpertlearning. 

Despite encountering challenges in seeking certain answers, I exerted my utmost effort and determination to successfully get the results for the projects.
